## How to run the game
To play the game, clone the project to your computer and run the class named GameWindow. Included in the code is also a cheat method in wich you only need to move one brick in order to win. To use the cheat method, change the used method in TileGenerator - actionPerformed.

## Issues
Known issues with the game is that it only works properly on one of my dator's screens. On one of the screens it works perfect, on the other screen it works sporadically.
