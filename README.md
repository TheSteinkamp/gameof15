## How to run the game
1. Clone the repository
2. Compile the source files
3. Start the game: Run the compiled GameWindow class

## Developer features
A cheat method is built into the code, allowing the game to be won by only moving a single tile.
How to activate the cheat mode:
Modify the method call inside the TileGenerator.actionPerformed() method to utilize the cheat logic instead of the standard winning condition check.

## Issues
Graphical Inconsistency: Some users may experience graphical issues where the game's appearance or behavior is inconsistent, especially when using multiple monitors or screens with different scaling/resolutions. 
This is likely due to Swing's reliance on the underlying operating system's graphical handling.
